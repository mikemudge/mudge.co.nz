Need to create database for each application.
Along with users for application access.

Then need to initialze the databases for each application, create tables for each model.
This process would also upgrade the database based on the models/migration.

Each application needs a connection string to use for its own database.

Need to create a REST application based on the models, ability to support RBAC is nice to have.
models would require RBAC fields to have RBAC enabled? create/modify users/teams?

REST application/endpoints allows crud of the db table for each model

The primary interaction for developers should be the model.
Changes to models to propergate to the RESTful API, DB and validation/schema.
