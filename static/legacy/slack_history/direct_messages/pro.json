I think I was wrong. \nI have the grid floor in web director offset slightly so it would render over any background/floor textures. \nIt was set to 0.01 cm and I think I failed to convert that into meters when we updated the units used in web director.\nWhich means it would actually be rendering the grid 10mm higher than ground, and explain why Lucas needs to locate the assets below the grid.",
