init command to recreate client + scopes.
could also add my default user.

trail
read_profile
basic
profile
user
Better errors when scope or client is bad (invalid basic auth?)

Better 404 handling if a trail doesn't exist?
Better testing that migrations work.

Double user creation?
Make email unique for users?

figure out how to docker run tests???
Using the postgres db to store test data?
