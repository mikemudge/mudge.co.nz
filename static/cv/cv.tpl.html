    <div class="about section">
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer with over 15 years of experience, with a wide range of knowledge and a sound understanding of the
        complexities in modern application development. Having worked in both large international companies and
        smaller local startups, I have a proven record of making quick decisions under pressure in order to maintain quality while still delivering within tight deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Staff Engineer, I mentor engineers from several teams, influencing them to adopt consistent software patterns,
        architect solutions which handle scale, managing potential failure modes, backwards compatibility.
        I find tackling the hardest challenges to be the most satisfactory, and love to innovate and optimize my solutions to unique problems.
        I like the variety in supporting multiple services and applications across the board to gain a full view of the company’s products.

        <div class="company">Sailthru</div>
        <div class="year">2018-present</div>
        <p>
          I joined Sailthru as a Site Reliability Engineer, was promoted twice, currently a Staff Engineer.
          I support multiple teams, with a wide variety of products to enable Personalized Marketing via Email, Sms, Onsite and Push notifications.

        <div>
          <p class="project">Cloud Migration</p>
          With a company goal to migrate our data center to AWS, I led the migration of Sailthru's legacy php applications, consisting of 6 web services, ~20 processes (E.g queue consumers) and around 90 cronjobs.
          Dependencies such as Mongo DB, Active MQ and Kafka were also migrated as part of this effort.<br>
          Key results I delivered include:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Upgraded PHP to a supported version (Php 5 -> 7)</li>
          <li>Introduced new CI pipeline, dependency management (composer) and staging environment</li>
          <li>Containerized applications so they could be run with docker and EKS. </li>
          <li>Refactored stateful applications to use s3 to be able to be run in a stateless manner </li>
          <li>Parallelized deployments to reduce duration from ~40m to 5m </li>
          <li>Improved logging, monitoring and alerts to ensure application health throughout migration</li>
          <li>Zero downtime migration to kubernetes (EKS)</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Incident Management</p>
          The Platform team has the most in-depth knowledge of the Sailthru stack, while on this team I:
          <ul>
            <li>Handled tickets escalated to us, which were the most difficult ones
              <ul>
                <li>Deep-dived into the inner workings of Mongo and Kafka</li>
                <li>Investigated complex race conditions across multiple applications</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Was On-call for a number of legacy services with limited observability</li>
            <li>Navigated unfamiliar code to quickly identify root causes during incident remediation</li>
            <li>Balanced short term workarounds and long term redesigning of system components</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented rollout plans for risky changes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Best Practices</p>
          Working with legacy code has made me advocate for consistency through better processes:
          <ul>
              <li>Documentation, diagrams and ADR's (Architecture Decision Records)</li>
              <li>Observability - health checks, metrics, logging and traces</li>
              <li>Application design - API's, exception handling, idempotency, design patterns</li>
              <li>CI/CD, unit testing and run books</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          As one of the early SWEs at 8i, I worked on a variety of solo projects including VR webapps.
          VR was a developing field and I innovated with our designer to develop a volumetric video player, volumetric scene creator and an augmented map overlay for volumetric videos.
          As the team rapidly grew, I later focused on backend development and API design for our AR app Holo on Web, Android and iOS.
