The company is closed from the 24th Dec --&gt; 4 Jan *inclusive*, meaning our last day is the 23rd and first day back is the 5th. I see you've made a booking in iPayroll from the 25th to the 4th, so I just wanted to confirm that you're not planning to work on the 24th and that I should change the booking to reflect this?",
