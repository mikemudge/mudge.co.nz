    <div class="about section">
      <p>
        I’m a software developer with over 10 years of experience with an excellent understanding of a
        variety of computer languages. Having worked in both large international companies and
        smaller, local startups, I have a wide range of knowledge and a sound understanding of the
        complexities in modern application development. I’m capable of making quick decisions under
        pressure in order to maintain quality while still delivering within deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am comfortable working as part of both small and large teams or working autonomously as a
        self-starter. I’d prefer to work in a small, diverse team which has multiple responsibilities, in a
        company where continued learning is encouraged. I enjoy the variety in being able to support
        multiple services and applications across the board and gain a full understanding of the
        company’s products and/or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received a 1st Class (Hons) degree in Computer Science from Victoria University, Wellington.

      <div class="job">
        <div class="company">8i</div>
        <div class="year">2015-2017</div>

        <p>
          As one of the early developers at 8i I worked on a variety of projects, starting off on several solo projects before working on our AR app, Holo, with a larger team. As the company grew I was looked upon to provide history and context for the engineering teams, handing over code as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Website</div>
          I redeveloped 8i.com twice using Wagtail/Django running on Amazon cloud.
          The front-end started with Angular, moving to jQuery/JavaScript and HTML with CSS.
          I integrated Sphinx for documentation and used markdown from 8i Plugins to generate HTML.
          I implemented the site with a CMS which allowed for content managers to have complete control of the content, including uploading new images and creating sub models for listed content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Web Player</div>
          I developed a web player similar to YouTube for playing our volumetric videos using three.js. This required an understanding of 3D vector mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Holo Content Platform</div>
          I worked in a team of two to build the backend and CMS for Holo.
          Holo had 1,000,000+ downloads and was dealing with an average of ~150 users at a time.
          Backend was distributed using Amazon’s ECS and EC2 using docker images for easy rollback.
          It used BuildKite agents to continuously test and deploy automatically from Github.
          Content requirements included user access controls, content grouped by character, tags and promotions.
          It also required content creation, including file upload to Amazon, screenshot generation, grouping/ordering and adding metadata. Also supported Draft/Private and Published content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Director</div>
          I developed a web editor allowing creation of a scene to compliment our volumetric videos.
          I was responsible for the implementation and delivery, but I worked with developers, product owners and others to define a flexible, extendable scene graph schema. It supported adding 8i 3D videos, 3D models (obj format), additional audio, background photo spheres, 3D text and 2D images as a plane. Each item had a timeline of keyframes for position, rotation and scale as appropriate.
          8i worked with Life magazine to create the “Buzz Aldrin: Cycling Pathways to Mars” VR experience and web director was used to create a teaser while the full VR experience was being worked on.

        <div class="company">Google</div>
        <span class="year">2012 - 2015</span>
        <p>
          I worked in Mountain View, California as a Software Engineer in Google Payments (Google Wallet) for three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Wallet JS API</div>
          An API for third party websites making integration easy for merchants (e.g. newegg.com). I also worked on gathering analytics and using those to increase purchase conversion. I was on the initial product launch team and the subsequent on-call team for maintenance and several feature releases.
        </p>
        <p>

          <div class="project">Wallet Backend</div>
          I was part of a team which migrated the backend used by the JS, Android and iOS clients dealing with ~$1m of purchases per day to a new framework. Ensuring backwards and forwards compatibility between traffic to the old and new servers.  The work I contributed to this and the previous project got me promoted to the next level of software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Frontend Payment UI</div>
          Worked on a project to consolidate all payment UI components while still supporting and building new UI components for the latest Google projects (such as Project Fi and Youtube rent/purchase). Worked closely with designers and material design to build out a shopping cart component with flexibility to support international prices, line items and taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="project">Application Development</div>
          During my time at Google I learned a lot about the best practices of developing a product, including maintaining environments for development, testing, canary and production, pushing and rolling back environments, running unit, functional and smoke tests against those environments and feature protection using flags and experiments for a slow, controlled roll out.

          <p>
            I have used Java since I was 15. Discovering it through a course at high school but then spending my free time doing little projects after school because I enjoyed it so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went through a progression of learning about classes and objects and then how the principles of OO and using design patterns help to write code which is easier to reuse and understand. And when combined sensibly can be used to solve large programming problems.

            Previous jobs which I have worked in had me as the only IT person. I had no one who I could turn to for help meaning it was up to me to research and implement a solution for all problems which came up.
