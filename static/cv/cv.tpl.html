    <div class="about section">
      <p>

        I’m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience, with a wide range of knowledge and a sound understanding of the
        complexities in modern application development. Having worked in both large international companies and
        smaller local startups, I have a proven record of making quick decisions under
        pressure in order to maintain quality while still delivering within tight deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a tech lead, I mentor engineers on my team and cross-functional teams, influencing them to adopt consistent software patterns.
        I find tackling the hardest challenges to be the most satisfactory, and love to innovate and optimize my solutions to unique problems.
        I like the variety in supporting multiple services and applications across the board to gain a full view of the
        company’s products.

      <div class="job">
        <div class="company">Sailthru</div>
        <div class="year">2018-present</div>
        <p>
          I joined Sailthru as a Site Reliability Engineer, supporting a large number of products to enable Personalized Marketing via Email, Onsite and Push notifications.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Cloud Migration</p>
          With a company goal to migrate our data center to AWS, I led the migration of Sailthru's php applications, consisting of 6 web services, 20 queue consumers and many cronjobs.
          Dependencies such as Mongo DB, Active MQ and Kafka were also migrated as part of this effort.<br>
          Key results I delivered include:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduced CI pipeline, dependency management and staging environment</li>
          <li>Upgraded PHP to a supported version</li>
          <li>Redesigned applications to follow cloud standard</li>
          <li>Parallelized deployments to reduce duration from ~40m to 5m </li>
          <li>Improved logging, monitoring and alerts</li>
          <li>Zero downtime migration to kubernetes (EKS)</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Incident Management</p>
          The SRE team has the most in-depth knowledge of the Sailthru stack, while on the team I:
          <ul>
            <li>Handled tickets escalated to us, which were the most difficult ones
              <ul>
                <li>Deep-dived into the inner workings of Mongo and Kafka</li>
                <li>Investigated complex race conditions across multiple applications</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On-call for a large number of legacy services with limited observability</li>
            <li>Navigated unfamiliar code to quickly identify root causes during incident remediation</li>
            <li>Balanced short term workarounds and long term redesigning of system components</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented rollout plans for risky changes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Best Practices</p>
          Working with legacy code has made me advocate for consistency through better processes:
          <ul>
              <li>Documentation, architecture diagrams and RFC's</li>
              <li>Observability - health checks, metrics, logging and traces</li>
              <li>Application design - API's, exception handling, idempotency, design patterns</li>
              <li>CI/CD, unit testing and run books</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Leadership</p>
          Being the first remote worker with a 6-8 hour time difference from the New York team, I helped create processes to enable effective communication.
          As the processes matured, I worked with team leads to onboard new hires across timezones.
          <ul>
            <li>Mentored coworkers from multiple teams</li>
            <li>Code reviews across engineering teams, driving for readability</li>
            <li>Documentation to help developers navigate local development setup</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          As one of the early SWEs at 8i, I worked on a variety of solo projects including VR webapps.
          VR was a developing field and I innovated with our designer to develop a volumetric video player, volumetric scene creator and an augmented map overlay for volumetric videos.
          As the team rapidly grew, I later focused on backend development and API design for our AR app Holo on Web, Android and iOS.
