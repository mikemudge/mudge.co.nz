Potentially look at Flurry and/or Localytics.\n\nTokes will be reaching out with some other items.  But we're hoping to land on the Segment decision by end of week, so we can get the new SDK incorporated into the Clients and start feeding MixPanel and Google Analytics from there by end of next week.  Then we can play around with the other Analytics providers you identify.  And hopefully, within four weeks, we have identified our Analytics Recipe for the app.\n\nHow does that sound?",
