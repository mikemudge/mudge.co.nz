      <p>
        I’m a software engineer with over 15 years of experience, proficient at handling the complexities of modern software development.
        Having worked in both large corporations and local startups,
        I have a strong track record of driving alignment under pressure, ensuring quality and timely delivery.
        I thrive on challenges and enjoy developing innovative, optimized solutions to address unique problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Staff Engineer, I influence engineers from various teams by promoting standardized software patterns and
        designing scalable, reliable systems while maintaining backwards compatibility.
        I enjoy supporting multiple services, as this gives me a comprehensive view of my company’s products.

        <div class="year">2018-present</div>
        <p>
          I work with multiple teams at Sailthru to provide personalized marketing to 6 billion users
          via email, SMS, onsite and push notifications, generating 250+ million messages daily.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Leadership</p>
          I grew to a Staff Engineer at Sailthru, and my current responsibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>Work with engineering and product managers to plan for quarterly OKRs and sprints</li>
            <li>Review architecture designs for all teams</li>
            <li>Lead Platform and Devops initiatives, including SQS, EKS migrations, and Cloud cost optimizations</li>
            <li>Helped form and grow 2 new teams in 2025: Omnichannel and Subscriber Experiences</li>
            <li>Played a key role in establishing processes to help the company transition to a remote first workplace across opposite timezones</li>
            <li>Code reviews across engineering teams, promoting readability and consistency</li>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Cloud Migration</p>
          With a company goal to migrate our data center to AWS, I led the migration of Sailthru's legacy PHP applications:
          6 web services, ~20 processes (E.g. queue consumers), ~50 cronjobs, and
          the application dependencies (Mongo, Active MQ and Kafka).<br>
          Key results I delivered include:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Upgraded PHP (Version 5 -> 7)</li>
          <li>Containerized all applications </li>
          <li>Introduced dependency management tooling</li>
          <li>Introduced new CI/CD pipeline, with a staging environment; reduced deploy times from ~40m to 5m</li>
          <li>Refactored stateful applications to use S3 to run in a stateless manner </li>
          <li>Improved logging, monitoring and alerts to minimize migration disruptions</li>
          <li>Zero downtime migration to kubernetes (EKS)</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Incident Management</p>
          The Platform team has the most in-depth knowledge of the Sailthru stack, while on this team I:
          <ul>
            <li>Was On-call for a number of legacy services with limited observability</li>
            <li>Navigated unfamiliar code to quickly identify root causes during incident remediations</li>
            <li>Balanced short term workarounds and long term redesign of system components</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented rollout plans for risky changes</li>
            <li>Handled difficult/urgent client tickets when they were escalated to Engineering:
              <ul>
                <li>Deep-dived into the inner workings of Mongo and Kafka</li>
                <li>Investigated complex race conditions across multiple applications</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="project">Best Practices</p>
          My work with legacy code has led me to champion consistency and better processes:
          <ul>
              <li>Documentation, diagrams and ADR's (Architecture Decision Records)</li>
              <li>Observability - health checks, metrics, logging and tracing</li>
              <li>Application design - APIs, exception handling, idempotency, design patterns</li>
              <li>CI/CD, unit testing and runbooks</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="year">2015-2017</div>
        <p>
          As one of the first SWEs at 8i, I independently delivered a range of innovative VR webapps projects.
          As the team rapidly grew, I specialized in backend development and API design for our AR app Holo on Web, Android and iOS.
          VR was an emerging and fast-evolving field, and in collaboration with our designer, I developed a volumetric video player, volumetric scene creator and an augmented map overlay for volumetric videos.
